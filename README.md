# react mobx example

This is an example of react x mobx which is created by CRA. Did not use typescript here since I have tried but it got too complicated to use with `@inject` decorators. We have a simple button and a text display the count with a global injected `counterStore`. 

## Get started

```bash
yarn install
yarn start
yarn test
```
